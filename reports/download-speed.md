# Download engine: is it at the ceiling?

Date: 2026-10-10. Engine: `ps5-react` main at d1e4aa2. App: `game-store` main at 0b1837b.
Prototypes: `ps5-react` branch `perf/download-speed` (f9e6bd3), `game-store` branch
`perf/download-speed` (16118eb). Nothing pushed, released or deployed.

## Short answer

No. The beta log (`conns=25/27 recv=35479KB/s net_busy=22% retries=0`) is not limited by the line,
TLS, the network thread or storage. It is limited by **how many ranges the file has**, and the same
mechanism makes the end of every download (and every slow connection) run with few connections.
Multi-part releases are also capped at **8 connections** because the app never passes its options
for volumes.

Per connection the tester got 35.5 MB/s / 25 = **1.42 MB/s**, the per-connection share archive.org
gives. Throughput is roughly `connections x 1.4 MB/s`, so the connection count is the lever.

## 1. Where the ceiling is

| Suspect | Verdict | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Connection count (why 25-27, not 64) | **Ceiling** | Ranges are fixed 16 MiB (`download-queue.js:182`); a transfer slot only takes a whole unscheduled range (`network.cpp:1415-1425` at d1e4aa2). A file with N ranges never has more than N connections. The AIMD window grows only when full (`Window::grow`, `network.cpp:564`: 8, 12, 18, 27, 40, 60, 64, once a second), so with about 25 ranges left it stops at 27 with 25 in use, which is the tester's line. Reproduced on localhost with a 432 MiB file (27 ranges) at 1.4 MB/s per connection: `conns=27/40 recv=36936KB/s`, the same 37 MB/s plateau. |
| Tail effect | **Ceiling** | A 16 MiB range at 1.4 MB/s takes about 12 s. The last ranges run alone: the 432 MiB run spends its last 2 s at 9 connections; a 900 MiB file goes 56 to 38 to 16 connections over its last 4 s. There is no work stealing or slow-connection replacement. One 10x-slow connection holds the job for a whole range (120 s, below). |
| Multi-part sets (volumes) | **Ceiling, 8 connections** | `executeSet` enqueues without `connections`/`adaptive`/`rangeBytes` (`download-queue.js:416`), so it gets the engine defaults `connections = 8`, `range_bytes = 32 MiB` (`network.hpp:22-23`). Most of the catalog is multi-part (AkiraBox 4203, VikingFile 3937, 1fichier 2943, rootz 3400, MediaFire 2036 volume releases). Bench, 900 MiB volume: **9.7 MB/s** against 34.6 MB/s with 64 connections. |
| Ramp-up | Minor | 8 to 64 takes about 5 s per job (about 3 s of full-speed time lost). Every volume of a set ramps again from 8. |
| Server per-connection cap | Host property | archive.org: about 1.4 MB/s per connection in the log; it scales with connections (2026-10-07 Mac measurement). MediaFire: per client (below). |
| Network thread, TLS | Not the limit | `net_busy=22%` at 35 MB/s means it would saturate near 160 MB/s, above gigabit (117 MB/s, about 73% busy). The PS5 build links OpenSSL 3.5.2 with assembly (`aesni_ctr32_encrypt_blocks` and others in `libcrypto.a`) and curl 8.18.0. One `curl_multi` handle with `curl_multi_poll`, not select. |
| SO_RCVBUF | Not the limit | 2 MiB per socket (`network.cpp:528`). At 200 ms RTT that allows 10 MB/s per connection, 7x what the server gives. |
| HTTP version, keep-alive | Correct | HTTP/1.1 is forced (`configure_transport`). archive.org also speaks h2 (`HTTP/2 200` from the Mac), which would multiplex every range on one TCP connection and lose the per-connection share. Each transfer slot reuses its connection; a new range costs one RTT, about 2% at 16 MiB ranges. |
| Write path | Not the limit now | `disk == recv`, `buffered=3200KiB` of 16 MiB, `paused=0`: storage keeps up. `write_avg` is about 140 KiB because the two writers drain the queue (`queued=3`) faster than 25 transfers fill 128 KiB blocks, so batches rarely form. That is self-regulating: at about 3 ms per call two writers do about 85 MB/s with 128 KiB writes, and past that the queue grows and batches up to 2 MiB form. Watch `paused` and `buffered` at gigabit speeds. |
| Checkpoints | Not the limit | Every 5 s on its own thread (`queue_checkpoint`); `sync_max=0ms` in the log. |
| DNS | Not the limit | curl's per-multi DNS cache; one lookup per host per minute. |

Unconfirmed: whether the tester's file had about 25 ranges left (a file of about 400-430 MiB, or a
resumed one). The first lines of that log (`download: conns=8/8`, then the growth) and the file size
would settle it. A large file with these settings reaches 64 connections in about 5 s (bench below).

## 2. Measurements

### Harness

`reports/download-speed-bench/`: `server.go` serves a virtual file with Range, a strong ETag,
a token bucket per connection (`-conn`), one shared per client (`-client`), a delay before the first
byte (`-rtt`), a share of 10x-slow connections (`-slowfrac`) and HTTP 500 past N concurrent ranges
(`-maxbusy`), over HTTP or HTTPS. `client.cpp` links `native/shared/network.cpp` unchanged and
checks every byte of the result. Outputs went to a 1 GiB APFS RAM disk and were deleted.
"base" is d1e4aa2; "split" is the prototype.

### Localhost results (1.4 MB/s per connection, 150 ms first-byte delay, adaptive, all bytes verified)

| Scenario | Settings | base | split |
|---|---|---|---|
| 432 MiB file (27 ranges) | 64 conns, 16 MiB | 14.3 s, **31.7 MB/s**, peak 27 conns | 8.4 s, **53.9 MB/s**, peak 64 |
| 900 MiB file | 64, 16 MiB | 16.3 s, 58.0 MB/s, peak 57 | 14.3 s, 66.2 MB/s |
| 432 MiB, 15% of connections 10x slower | 64, 16 MiB | 121 s, **3.7 MB/s** | 21.3 s, **21.3 MB/s** |
| 900 MiB volume, app's current set options | 8, 32 MiB | 96.9 s, **9.7 MB/s** | 85.4 s, 11.1 MB/s |
| 900 MiB volume, 64 connections (app fix) | 64, 32 MiB | 27.3 s, 34.6 MB/s | 14.4 s, **65.4 MB/s** |
| Large file, steady state | 64, 16 MiB | 87.5 MB/s at 64 conns | 87.5 MB/s (no splits) |
| Busy origin (500 past 14 ranges), 432 MiB | 64, 16 MiB | 15.5 MB/s, 5 retries | 17.2 MB/s, 6 retries |
| Per-client cap 3 MB/s (MediaFire-like), 200 MiB | 8 or 64 | 3.0 MB/s | 3.0 MB/s |
| Same, plus one mirror on another host with the same cap | 64, 16 MiB | 5.5 MB/s | 5.8 MB/s |
| HTTPS, 432 MiB | 64, 16 MiB | 31.8 MB/s | 53.9 MB/s |

The ideal at 64 connections is 89.6 MB/s; steady state reaches 98% of it. Smaller fixed ranges
without splitting also help small files (432 MiB: 4 MiB ranges 47.9 MB/s, 8 MiB 44.1 MB/s), but
they cost about 3% in steady state and break the resume of existing partials, because the
checkpoint stores `range_bytes`.

### Internet, from the Mac (inconclusive)

The Mac's line was slow during this run: about 1.0-1.3 MB/s total to GitHub's CDN with 1 or 4
connections. archive.org gave 0.08 MB/s on one connection and 0.9 MB/s on 16. MediaFire gave
1.5 MB/s on 1 connection, 1.5 MB/s on 4, 0.95 MB/s on two different links together, and 1.4 MB/s
on 2 links x 4 connections. All of that is at the line's limit, so it cannot tell a per-IP cap from
a per-link cap. It does confirm that MediaFire direct links answer `accept-ranges: bytes` with **no
ETag and no Last-Modified** (resume goes through `check_sample`). Each volume is about 10 GB
(`content-length: 10630044057`).

## 3. Multi-source download

What exists (`network.cpp`): `Request::mirrors` (up to 4), `verify_mirrors` (a probe per mirror:
same size, and the same strong ETag, or a SHA-256 when the primary has no ETag), `pick_mirror`
(each transfer slot sticks to one server), one AIMD window per host, and `forget_mirror` (a mirror
that fails a range is dropped and the range goes back to the primary). Bench: one mirror on a
second capped host takes 3.0 MB/s to 5.5-5.8 MB/s (ideal 6).

Why the app cannot use it today:

1. Cross-host mirrors are always rejected when the primary has a strong ETag (archive.org does),
   because `verify_mirrors` and `valid_file_response` compare every range with the **primary's**
   ETag and Last-Modified. Each mirror needs its own validators.
2. With no ETag (MediaFire), a mirror is accepted only with a whole-file SHA-256. The catalog has
   it for **6 of 32,694** releases.
3. The app strips mirrors (`download-queue.js:180-182`, "one server keeps the heap's margin for
   images").

What it would take to do safely: size equality, then a sampled identity check (for example 64 KiB
at 0, 1/3, 2/3 and the last 64 KiB from every source, compared byte for byte with the primary), each
mirror's own validators for its ranges, and the existing whole-file SHA-256 when known. Volumes are
RAR parts with CRCs, so a wrong upload is also caught at extraction, but only after the download.
Candidates are a volume's other `sources[]` (other hosts with the same part). Expected gain on
capped hosts: about +1x the cap per independent host, so about 2x with one extra host. A second
link of the same MediaFire file gains nothing if the cap is per IP, which is likely but unconfirmed
(see above).

## 4. Ranking

| # | Change | Expected gain | Effort | Risk | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Volumes use `connections: 64, adaptive: true` (keep the 32 MiB ranges so partials resume) | Up to **3.5x** on per-connection hosts (9.7 to 34.6 MB/s), **6.7x** with #2. Nothing on per-client caps | 1 line | ~0: same settings the single-file path ships with | **Done**: game-store 16118eb, 75/75 queue tests |
| 2 | Engine tail splitting: idle connections take the second half of the range with the most bytes left (down to 1 MiB) | +70% under 1 GiB, +14% at 900 MiB, 5.7x with slow connections, 0 on large-file steady state | ~70 lines | Low: verified bytes in every bench run, 100 stress runs, cancel and resume mid-split, HTTPS, PS5 cross-compile with `-Werror`, `tools/test_network.py` passes with a new split and split-retry test | **Done**: ps5-react f9e6bd3 |
| 3 | Keep each host's learned window across jobs, so volumes 2..N start at the window volume 1 reached | About 3 s of full speed per volume | Small | Low (AIMD still shrinks on 5xx) | Recommended |
| 4 | Multi-source across hosts with sampled identity check and per-mirror validators | About 2x on capped hosts (MediaFire) when a second host has the same part | Medium-high | Medium (identity, heap) | Recommended after #1-#2 |
| 5 | Two volumes in parallel, if a host caps per link rather than per IP | Up to 2x on those hosts | High (the engine runs one job at a time) | Medium | Only if a console test shows a per-link cap |
| 6 | Writer gathering (wait a few ms for contiguous blocks) | Only above about 80 MB/s | Small | Low | Not needed yet |

### The split prototype in detail (f9e6bd3)

- A transfer keeps `requested` (what the server was asked for) apart from `length` (where it ends
  now). Responses are still validated against `requested`.
- When no unscheduled range is ready and the origin's window has room, an idle slot first takes a
  waiting span (a split part that failed), else cuts the active transfer with the most bytes left
  (more than 2 MiB) at half its remainder.
- The cut transfer drops bytes past its new end (returning fewer would fail it, and
  `curl_easy_pause` with it: the first version hit exactly that, 1 run in 25) and the loop removes
  it once complete; its connection closes.
- A range completes when all its parts do (`open` count); checkpoints are unchanged (a range is
  recorded only when whole), so the resume format and old partials are unaffected. A failed part of
  a split range retries alone, with the same per-range attempt limits.
- Manifest (`pieces`) jobs and non-ranged downloads never split.
- The stat line gains `splits=N`.

## What needs a console test

1. The beta tester's case: send the first and last stat lines and the file size. Then run the split
   build on an archive.org file under 1 GiB and one over 2 GiB: `conns` should reach 64, `splits`
   grow only near the end, and `retries` should not jump (archive.org 500s with more connections),
   with `heap=` peak no higher than today.
2. A multi-part VikingFile, AkiraBox or Buzzheavier set with the app fix: does the speed scale with
   64 connections, or is that host capped per client like MediaFire?
3. MediaFire per IP or per link: two volumes of one release downloaded at once on a fast line
   (the Mac's line was too slow today).
4. At gigabit speeds: whether `paused` or `buffered` near 16 MiB show storage becoming the limit.
