# Hardware evidence

## User-confirmed baseline — 2026-10-05

PS5 Slim Digital, firmware 13.60, kstuff and ShadowMount active, without etaHEN.
Title `PPSA99052`, uploaded as an extracted folder under `/data/homebrew/`.

The user confirmed responsive rendering, D-pad focus, Cross confirmation,
counter state updates, and Options returning to the system home screen.
The proof of concept intentionally exits after 30 seconds. FPS was not measured.

Confirmed executable SHA-256:
`b4d154838f1df886288ffd938e57336caf07158bdcd82d0f1e2622d098db3339`.

The debug PKG `PPSA99051` failed to launch with CE-100022-5. This alone does
not identify the cause; the same executable worked through the folder workflow.

## Framework starter

`PPSA99053` is a new identity and build with extracted configuration and APIs.
It does not automatically inherit the proof of concept's hardware status.
The build receipt sets `hardware_tested: false` pending a test of that artifact.

Validation procedure: launch PS5 React Starter, move focus, update the counter,
return, exit with Options, and verify the configured timeout. Changes to the
host or SDK need new validation. Desktop tests and ELF checks do not establish
PS5 execution or support for other firmware/loader combinations.

## System Explorer storage crash — 2026-10-05

The user reported a crash after the storage-query change. PS5Upload's read-only
syslog and kernel-log endpoints captured two `PPSA99056` executions (PIDs 194
and 197). Both initialized graphics, QuickJS, the bundle, and presented a frame.
Both then logged `native fs.readDir`, `native fs.diskUsage`, followed by:

```text
PPRBUG-22859: the process pid=197 directly issued a syscall 396 at 0x400b37
exception: 0xa002030a (SYSTEM_ILLEGAL_FUNCTION_CALL)
```

This establishes that the direct `statfs` syscall caused this app termination.
The raw `getfsstat` call was not reached; it has also been removed rather than
repeating the same unsupported route. No system-UI modification was involved.

The replacement calls the native-title `_fstatfs` export through an opened
descriptor, following ProsperoStore's storage probe. Mount discovery uses bounded
queries of accessible paths. Directory parsing now rejects malformed records.
These changes compile and pass local tests but have not been hardware-validated.
Existing rendering evidence does not establish storage support.

The user subsequently reported `Operation not permitted` from the native-wrapper
build (`df14dd51f9fcc03c3da2e97c9839d93d8448978bd0e302c5fae1a1118ea366a5`).
The new System Explorer packages an opt-in upstream Lapy exact-title helper and
requests filesystem access once at startup. Localhost ELF loader port 9021 was
reachable during investigation. This is a transport check, not an elevation or
storage-success test. The new integration remains hardware-unvalidated.

The user tested the helper build and still reported `EPERM`. Captured syslog
shows `filesystem access status=9 path=helper`: a transport failure, not a
successful elevation followed by a storage error. The bootstrap was missing
libSceNet initialization and a network pool. The replacement initializes them
before the client request and logs socket creation, socket options, connection,
and send/receive failures with libSceNet's own error value. It still needs a
console test; network initialization is a source-confirmed missing step, not a
hardware-confirmed explanation of every transport failure.

The network-initialized artifact (`eboot.bin` SHA-256
`21581994b1143175288abe71838554480c8a7f8d0535ca185a0291500a85d9b8`)
connected to the ELF loader successfully. Its helper (SHA-256
`0117526a829bc55ead25a5c6633775e7aee4798aca738370d07dd2abbf08e313`)
crashed with SIGILL at SDK v0.40 startup/termination address `0x200006a38`.
The client received EOF and access status 9; the user still reported EPERM.
This confirms transport worked but filesystem elevation did not complete.
The SDK v0.42 helper replacement is pending hardware validation.

The replacement helper SHA-256 is
`2df1a7bcee26b183aa082081f47fd39a91e7039b9f420bd0eedc1ffaeda0d56b`.
The application executable is unchanged; identify this test by the helper hash.
Local compilation, exact-title protocol tests and ELF/SELF/package checks pass.
A native mock test using the actual patched credential functions confirms full
32-byte save/restore, retention of bytes 1–31, detection of high-byte mismatch
and rejection of failed attribute reads. These do not establish console access.

## System Explorer filesystem success — 2026-10-05

The user confirmed the replacement worked on the same PS5 Slim Digital,
firmware 13.60, with kstuff and ShadowMount, without etaHEN. This confirmation
applies to the native filesystem integration being tested: directory listing,
mount discovery and disk usage after the exact-title helper startup.

Tested title: `PPSA99056`, uploaded as a complete extracted application folder.
Application SHA-256:
`21581994b1143175288abe71838554480c8a7f8d0535ca185a0291500a85d9b8`.
Helper SHA-256:
`2df1a7bcee26b183aa082081f47fd39a91e7039b9f420bd0eedc1ffaeda0d56b`.
Both application and helper use payload SDK v0.42. The helper includes the
pinned 32-byte credential-attributes compatibility patch.

Evidence is the user's direct confirmation, not a captured successful syscall
trace or a measurement of every mount. It does not qualify unrelated native
modules, every filesystem operation, other firmware, or later rebuilt hashes.
Generated build receipts continue to default to `hardware_tested: false`; use
this record to identify the qualified artifacts.

## PKG installation — 2026-10-08

CFI-series console on firmware 13.60 (kernel `r229358/releases/13.60`), kstuff-lite,
John Törnblom's ELF loader on port 9021. `pkg-installer.elf` sent from a Mac to the
loader installed `CUSA04286` (BATTLESHIP, PS4 fake PKG, 1,246,167,040 bytes) from
`/data/downloads/packages/`: `transferring` for 15 s, `promoting`, then `playable`
at 16 s. A first build that imported `libSceAppInstUtil` never reached `main`; the
library is loaded by path. The in-app route (engine to loader on 127.0.0.1) is
recorded separately once tested.

## Render workers — 2026-10-10

Firmware 13.60, kstuff, etaHEN and ShadowMountPlus 1.7beta4. A development
build of uncommitted render-worker changes ran a private 3840×2160 app (not in
this repository) through the same scripted tour of browsing, scrolling and page
changes, with `dev/render-workers.txt` picking the count. The title saw 16 CPUs.
"Heavy" windows are one-second windows repainting more than 500 kilopixels per
frame; frames right after each tour screenshot are excluded.

| Workers | Heavy-window raster | Slow frames | Time over 16.7 ms | Full-screen raster (median) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 23.1 ms | 160 | 9.3 s | 53.2 ms |
| 2 | 13.2 ms | 114 | 4.8 s | 34.2 ms |
| 4 | 10.1 ms | 71 | 3.3 s | 29.7 ms |
| 8 | 10.3 ms | 44 | 2.7 s | 15.7 ms |

With 768-row opacity strips the heap dropped to 192 MiB (328 MiB of flexible
memory free); 128-row strips rendered the tour at the same speed with the heap
at 256 MiB (368 MiB free) and identical screenshots apart from the clock. A
1920×1080 build of the same app at eight workers against the build before the
change: heavy-window raster 7.1 → 3.3 ms, slow frames 80 → 22, full-screen
present 0.9 ms in both. The starter has not been run with this change.

A later revision of the same app and tour (more pages, so not comparable with
the table above) then measured the two Embedded React patches below, each run
once, at eight workers. Screenshot frames are excluded.

| Build | Slow frames | Time over 16.7 ms | Row-scroll frames over | Full-screen fade frames over |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Before both | 36 | 1406 ms | 15 (574 ms) | 10 (272 ms) |
| Kept transform sources | 29 | 1024 ms | 10 (226 ms) | 8 (235 ms) |
| Plus deferred raster | 16 | 664 ms | 1 (28 ms) | 4 (82 ms) |

A focused card's scale animation took 30–43 ms per frame before its transform
source was kept, and about 3 ms after. The deferred-raster screenshots differ
from the previous build in under 0.07% of pixels, at the clock and a focus ring
caught mid-animation.

All three builds drew full-width scaled images only 2560 px wide, so the app's
hero backdrop lost its right third and its crossfades cost a third less than
they should. With that fixed (the wide-rows patch), the same tour showed the
whole backdrop and spent 1328 ms over budget in 50 slow frames: 39 full-screen
crossfade frames (765 ms, about 30 ms of raster each), 9 React frames (511 ms)
and 1 row-scroll frame (20 ms).

With `ERUI_MAX_NODES` and the bridge handles at 4096 and the app's home screen
kept mounted while hidden, the heap still took 256 MiB (104 MiB of flexible
memory free after it, against 107 MiB). Idle commits spent 0.1 ms in the damage
pre-pass and flag sweep, and no slow frame more than 0.3 ms. Deepest render
recursion over the tour, measured on the desktop preview: about 115 KiB of
stack at 8.8 KiB per level, against the workers' 1 MiB. Keeping the screen's
images held pinned about 60 MiB of decoded art while the next page loaded (heap
peak 238 MiB, one failed allocation, retried); under `ReleaseImages` the peak
was 176 MiB. Returning to it took a 79–81 ms frame (45–47 ms of React) and an
81 ms frame of focus handling, instead of rebuilding it. Idle collections held
7.4–9.2 MiB live against 3.5–7.2 MiB, and paused 14–34 ms against 10–32 ms.

The app's backdrops then became `<Image layer>`, drawn by the presenter beneath
the framebuffer, with finished image loads delivered under a per-frame budget.
One build, the same tour, once with layers and once with `dev/layers.txt` at 0:

| Build | Slow frames | Time over 16.7 ms | Full-screen crossfade frames over |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Layers off | 45 | 1243 ms | 21 (446 ms) |
| Layers on | 26 | 832 ms | 0 |

What remains is React and layout work when a page mounts, mostly in the frame
an exit animation completes: 25–68 ms of React per tab switch, 83 ms for a
search keystroke, 200 ms for three quick L1 presses back to the home screen.
With layers on, full-screen slow frames spent a median 4.9 ms in present, against
3.7 ms; the PS5 present also includes the wait for the display.

Later builds of the same day, the same tour, one run each:

| Build | Time over 16.7 ms |
| --- | --- |
| Layers on (above) | 832 ms |
| Pages kept by `Screens`, preloaded | 842 ms |
| Plus idle collections waiting for a still screen | 694 ms |
| Plus label changes re-rendering only label users | about 495 ms |
| Plus the fix for nodes translated off screen | about 403 ms |
| Plus the 8 MiB collection room | about 419 ms |

Before the label change, a tab switch re-rendered about 157 motion elements and
three quick L1 presses took a 203 ms frame; after it, 69 ms (45 ms of React).
The last three rows differ by less than run-to-run noise in React time; what is
left is React work when a page mounts or a search key is pressed (40–63 ms).

A details sheet sliding 360 px over the screen, opened and closed twice with
every frame over 20 ms logged: before the translate copy every frame of both
slides took 20–24 ms (10–16 ms of raster); with it, only the frame that mounts
the page (39–55 ms, 16–30 ms of React) and the first frame of each exit (21 ms)
went over.

Garbage collection, a scripted burst of detail pages and grid scrolling, the
same build with three scheduling policies:

| Policy | Runs | Automatic collections | Idle pauses | Time over 16.7 ms |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Room 1.5× live, no still wait | 2 | 1 each, in a full-screen frame (51–58 ms) | 12–32 ms | 232–253 ms |
| Room at least 8 MiB, still wait with valve | 1 | 0 | 16, 26, 33 ms | 181 ms |
| Same, idle trigger at a sixth of live | 3 | 0 | five per run, 12–33 ms | 225–239 ms |

Every idle pause landed in a frame that repainted under 2% of the screen. A
longer session of fast browsing still reached the 8 MiB room once (a 79 ms
detail-page frame against 39 ms) and then paused 48 ms at 17.5 MiB live.

## Not yet validated

- `Power.keepAwake` (ABI v4, `sceSystemServicePowerTick` every 30 s): builds,
  but no console has been observed staying out of rest mode with it on.

## Remote images — 2026-10-06

Overdrive (`PPSA99058`, game-store `65a3e58`) on the same PS5 Slim Digital,
firmware 13.60, kstuff, console filesystem elevation through the bundled
helper. A development build of ps5-react `b6047eb` with an uncommitted
per-frame motion log, screenshot command and heap log loaded every cover,
hero, logo and screenshot from the Steam and Spectrum CDNs; console
screenshots show them on browse and game pages.

- Held-key scroll on browse (14 down, 14 up) while covers streamed in: 225
  motion frames, none motionless, longest frame 17.7 ms, none over 20 ms.
- One-second windows: 59.9–60.0 fps, p95 17.3 ms. Game page mount 25 ms
  (cached art); user-driven mounts of uncached pages 43–88 ms, all JavaScript.
- 128 MiB heap: live 64–71 MiB on browse, about 80 MiB with a game page, peak
  98 MiB, no allocation failures.

The release artifact without diagnostics (eboot SHA-256
`4592332f53eaa597116faee4ecf98d1edb3d512a896b9cd426c4c35a7d0c7606`) was
installed and launched: first frame and 60 fps windows, not re-measured in
detail. Downloads were not exercised.

### Image loading latency — 2026-10-06

Same console, Overdrive game-store `ee3d2a4`, ps5-react `6bfdbec` (official
eboot SHA-256 `9f6486d9ddf6037762dfd3a579038b40622efb95afa795634d2fa57e0f943569`).
Per-image timings came from a temporary log in a development build; the 76
images a cold launch mounts before its first screenshot:

| Launch | Median to visible | Slowest |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Network, 4 connections | 4.2 s | 5.7 s (queued up to 5.2 s) |
| Network, 12 connections | 1.8 s | 2.5 s |
| Disk cache (relaunch) | 0.15 s | network only for art not cached |

A Steam CDN request takes about 250 ms (750 ms for the first, with DNS and
TLS); decode and resample take 1–30 ms on the decode worker. Opening a game
page whose card had focus for 300 ms showed hero, cover, logo and first shot
in the first screenshot 300 ms later; without the settle the hero arrived
after 0.7 s and the first shot after 1.1 s. Scroll windows stayed at
59.9–60.2 fps with frames under 20 ms while images arrived.
