# Changelog

## Unreleased — international text

- Add the `latin-ext`, `cyrillic` and `european` baked glyph sets, so runtime
  text in Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Indonesian, Russian and the other
  European languages renders without listing each letter (docs/TEXT.md).
- Draw Chinese and Japanese text: app.json `textFonts` packages subset Noto Sans
  SC (GB 2312) and JP (JIS X 0208) fonts, which HarfBuzz shapes and rasterizes
  on demand into a 4 MiB glyph cache, loading each font only when text needs
  it. CJK text breaks between characters with basic kinsoku rules.
  `Fonts.setLanguage` (ABI v6) picks Japanese or Chinese Han forms; it defaults
  to the system language.
- Shape Hindi (Devanagari), Bengali, Arabic and Urdu with HarfBuzz and order
  right-to-left text with the Unicode bidi algorithm (SheenBidi 3.0.0); add
  `textFonts` `devanagari`, `bengali` and `arabic`. The inherited `direction`
  style lays rows out right to left, Text takes `writingDirection`, and
  `textAlign` gains `start` (now the default) and `end`, which `text-start` and
  `text-end` compile to.

## Unreleased — native archive extraction

- Add cancellable `Archives.extract` with streaming ordered-volume extraction,
  bounded output, safe paths, atomic staging and SHA-256 completion recovery.
- Reuse native task polling and integrity hashing for HTTP and archive workers.
- Link pinned PacBrew archive/compression ports into native PS5 titles; add
  `tools/build_ps5.py --compile-only` for package-free linker validation.

## Unreleased

- Remote images load lazily: an element's image reaches the network after 120 ms mounted, and no
  request starts while a ScrollView moves or for 150 ms after (new internal `image.defer`). Holding
  Down through Overdrive's grid for 3 s fetched 45 covers instead of 140 and decoded 69 instead of 167;
  cached art still draws at once.
- Image requests retry connection failures, timeouts and 429/502/503/504 four times, 0.5 to 4 s apart
  (was twice, 0.5 and 1 s), use at most 8 keep-alive connections per origin, and cache hits no longer
  wait for a free connection.
- The decoded image cache holds 64 MiB and 256 images (was 24 MiB, 128); the PS5 host keeps 64 MiB
  with a 256 MiB heap, 40 MiB from 192 MiB and 24 MiB below.
- The PS5 memory log adds `[PS5-REACT] images:` counters (cache, disk and network loads, decode and
  time-to-pixels averages, cancellations, retries, failures, busiest origins); the desktop preview
  prints it too.
- Download checkpoints and completion receipts no longer include URLs: a signed link that expired
  can be resolved again and the partial resumes, as long as the size, hash and validator match.
  Servers without a strong ETag download in parallel ranges and resume too: `Last-Modified` guards
  the ranges, and before a resume without a strong ETag the last 64 KiB kept is re-read from the
  server and compared. HTTP 401/403 on a range now reports "provider denied the file" instead of a
  changed resource.
- `recoverCompleted` no longer reads the whole file to hash it when the request has no `sha256`,
  neither after the download nor when recovering it: the receipt's root, inode, size and request
  identity name the file. A requested hash is still verified both times.
- Add `Archives.inspect(sources)`: the kind of file the leading bytes show (RAR, 7z, ZIP, TAR and
  compressed TAR, PKG, exFAT/UFS2/PFS images) and, for RAR and xz/zstd, a decoder-memory refusal
  from the headers read so far, also on a partial download. `DownloadFormats.detected` routes a
  file by that kind; `tar.bz2`, `tar.xz` and `tar.zst` are archive formats.
- Add `FileSystem.removeTree(path)`: removes a directory with its contents without following
  symbolic links, so an app can delete a finished download's whole folder.
- Up to 128 `<Svg>` nodes can be mounted at once, from 64 (288 KB more .bss). Overdrive with two dozen
  favorites mounted more than 64 icons and its legend glyphs drew nothing.
- The idle collector keeps QuickJS's GC threshold at most 28 MiB, an eighth below the 32 MiB JS heap
  limit. QuickJS sets the threshold to 1.5 times what survived a collection and fails an allocation
  past the limit without collecting, so an app with over 21 MiB live (Overdrive's catalog) threw
  "out of memory" during a burst of input and its React tree stopped responding.
- Remote images on screen load newest first, ahead of every prefetch. An image counted as on screen
  once stayed so while a prefetch held it, so a held key queued hundreds of covers ahead of those
  shown; after 150 rows scrolled, on-screen covers waited 24 s (now 0.15 s on an M4). Images take
  32 connections instead of 12. `image.release(id, prefetch)` names the reference it drops.
- Add `Image.warm(uris)`: fills the disk cache in the background on up to four connections while
  no image waits, skipping cached URLs and files over 512 KiB, without decoding. The disk cache
  grows from 64 to 256 MiB.

- `Downloads.enqueue` takes `mirrors`: other URLs serving the same file. Verified ones share the
  ranges with the primary, and one that fails is dropped; servers that limit each host serve more
  together.

- Add `Image.getColor(uri)`: the art's most prominent vivid colour, computed on the
  decode worker, for accents or the controller light bar.

- Fix a PS5 crash when a download finished: titles have no `link()`, whose import
  bound to null. PS5 publication now always reserves the final name and renames.

- Allow up to 64 download connections (was 16) and a 16 MiB transfer buffer of 128 KiB blocks (was 8 MiB),
  written by two writers that join contiguous blocks into writes of up to 2 MiB:
  origins that throttle each connection, such as archive.org at about 1.4 MB/s,
  scale with connection count.

- PS5 notifications use libkernel's `sceKernelSendNotificationRequest` instead of a
  dlopen'd `sceNotificationSend`.

- Download ranges reuse the probe's final URL instead of repeating the redirect
  for every range, and fall back to the original URL if that target returns a
  client error. Adaptive concurrency starts at up to 8 connections and grows by
  2 per step. Resume checkpoints, which fsync the partial file, run on their own
  thread so a slow sync no longer stalls block writes and pauses every transfer.

- Verify PS5 data and temporary roots with exclusive write/read/remove probes
  after filesystem elevation. Readable but unwritable sandbox mounts now fall
  back to the title-owned `/data/ps5-react/<TITLE_ID>` directory, with explicit
  diagnostics if directory creation or the fallback proof fails.

- Expose effective HTTP URLs and allowlisted lowercase transfer headers; add
  `followRedirects: false` and opt-in `rejectHtml` download protection on both
  hosts. Cookies/authentication response headers stay private. Local transport
  tests cover redirect isolation and HTML rejection; PS5 validation is pending.
- Package explicit `resources` from app.json for on-demand data loading without
  embedding large catalogs in the JavaScript heap. Resource paths reject
  traversal, symlinks and collisions with package infrastructure.

- Refresh the README with an original project logo, complete first-app example,
  application configuration, Tailwind themes, focus/list navigation, animation,
  native API examples and troubleshooting. Document external-app editor setup
  and the font-size configuration needed for automatic baking.

- Add the `borderGradient` View style (`{type: 'conic', width, angle, stops}`)
  and the animatable `borderGradientAngle`: a conic gradient seen only through
  the rounded border ring, the classic rotating-gradient border. Turning it
  runs on the native driver and repaints only the border bands. Engine patch.
  See docs/ANIMATION.md.

- Add the `borderSweepColor`, `borderSweepWidth`, `borderSweepLength` and
  `borderSweepPhase` View styles: a light running around the rounded border
  like the PS5 focus ring, bright at its head and fading behind it. The phase
  animates on the native driver and repaints only the border bands. Engine
  patch. See docs/ANIMATION.md.

- Stop a growing list from repainting the whole screen while it scrolls: a
  container that paints nothing and only moved or resized (a `VirtualList`
  filling rows below the screen) damaged its whole box, the full viewport, on
  every frame, so the scroll copy saved nothing. Engine patch.

- Let focus scrolling catch up with a held key: once the target is more than a
  third of the viewport ahead, the speed cap rises with the distance, so tall
  rows no longer leave the screen a page behind focus (and a `VirtualList`
  mounting every row in between).

- Fix black rows in a `VirtualList` while a held key scrolls it: rows still on
  screen behind the scroll target were unmounted when tall rows let the target
  run ahead of the scroll, and a filling row could stop at its first card. The
  window now keeps every row between the scroll position and its target.

- Wrap bold text that is slightly wider than its box: lines broke at the
  regular glyph width, so a bold title a few pixels too wide drew as one line
  cut at the edge instead of continuing on its second line. Engine patch.

- Clip an `Image` to its `borderRadius`: covers drew square corners whatever
  `rounded-*` said. The bitmap now follows the same anti-aliased rounded shape
  as a background; square images draw as before. Fixed by an engine patch.

- Make a remote `<Image>` lighter: one component with one state object, one
  hook to re-render with and one effect, stable layout and load callbacks, and
  the host element rendered directly unless the image is focusable. Mounting
  and loading one takes about a quarter less JavaScript heap.

- Collect JavaScript garbage in idle frames: hosts count the QuickJS heap and
  run its collector half a second after the last input once a third of the
  room before its threshold is garbage, so a collection (40–70 ms on the PS5)
  lands in a pause rather than mid-scroll; the threshold is never raised. Each
  collection is logged as `gc: idle` or `gc: automatic`. `VirtualList` fill
  steps re-render the filling row alone and keep its existing cards, cutting
  the garbage a scroll through a grid leaves by about a third, and focusable elements
  use one effect fewer per render.

- Size a `Text` by the lines it actually wraps into: an auto-height text was one
  line tall (cutting wrapped text to its first line) or exactly `numberOfLines`
  lines whether or not it needed them. It now wraps at the width it gets, at
  most `numberOfLines`, also as a `flex-1` child of a row, which grows to hold
  it. Layouts that relied on `line-clamp-N` reserving N lines need a height.
  Fixed by an engine patch.

- Fix pieces of a sliding element left on screen, such as a header's section
  pill sliding while the screen under it changes: when an opaque element
  covered a repaint elsewhere, a translated element inside a clipping
  container recorded its untranslated position, so its next move erased the
  wrong area. Fixed by an engine patch.

- Add `Sound` (native ABI v5): import a 16-bit PCM WAV and the build bakes it
  into the app; `Sound.play(name, {volume, pan})` posts it to the
  ps5-homebrew-ui mixer, which renders on an audio thread (PS5: sceAudioOut;
  desktop: SDL), one voice per sound so a held D-pad does not stack ticks.
  `Sound.setVolume` sets the master volume. Add `useNavigationEvents`, which
  reports each focus move, blocked direction, press, back and button action
  with whether something handled it; `FocusManager.move` and `press` now
  return those outcomes. The starter and `npm run create` apps play a set
  derived from Google's Material Design sound resources (CC BY 4.0, prepared
  by `tools/ui_sounds.mjs`; attribution in `licenses/material-sounds-NOTICE.txt`)
  through `sounds.js`. Not yet validated on hardware. See docs/NATIVE-API.md.

- Add `Power.keepAwake(enabled)` (native API ABI v4) to keep the console out
  of rest mode during long downloads: the PS5 host ticks the system power
  timer every 30 s while it is on, the desktop preview toggles the screen
  saver. Not yet validated on hardware. See docs/NATIVE-API.md.

- Fix a translated element leaving its children behind: a `y` or `x`
  translate without scale or rotation moved only the element's own paint, so a
  header slid past the top edge stayed frozen on screen as its items, and a
  partial lift left a ghost strip. An engine patch moves the subtree and
  repaints the area it leaves. Sliding a bar off screen no longer needs a fade.

- Entering a `ScrollView` from outside it with the D-pad reaches only elements
  it shows at least in part: Right from the last header item no longer jumps
  to a card scrolled out of a rail. Moves inside a scroll view are unchanged.

- Add `scrollAnchor` on `View` and `Pressable`: a vertical `ScrollView` aligns
  the top of the focused element's nearest anchor (a section with its title,
  the hero) past the margin instead of revealing only the element, falling back
  to minimal movement when that would hide it. Add `ScrollView`
  `onScrollTarget({x, y})`, called with each new focus-scroll target. See
  docs/NAVIGATION.md.

- Deliver L1, R1, L2, R2, Triangle and Square as the `l1`, `r1`, `l2`, `r2`,
  `triangle` and `square` actions (host input protocol v3, versioned apart from the native API ABI): to `useController`, to
  the new `FocusScope.onAction` handler (innermost first, until one returns
  `true`), and to input scripts. Desktop: Q, E, Z, C, T, F and the
  controller's shoulders, triggers, Y and X. See docs/NAVIGATION.md.

- Add `VirtualList` for long lists and grids inside a `ScrollView`: it mounts
  the rows on screen, around focus and a little ahead of the scroll, filling
  rows ahead an item per frame, with spacers for the rest, `onEndReached` for
  incremental loading and optional row recycling. Lists taller than the engine's
  16-bit layout range re-centre the rows the content represents without moving
  anything on screen. `ScrollView` frames gain change listeners and `shift`.
  See [Long lists](docs/LISTS.md).

- Add the `shot:NAME` script step: test deploys save the frame on screen as
  `dev/NAME.bmp` (preview: the sandbox's `temp0/`), and `tools/ps5_shots.py`
  fetches them through PS5Upload as PNG. See docs/ANIMATION.md.

- Load `<Image source={{uri}}>` from http(s) URLs: native fetch and stb_image
  decode on two workers, resampled to the drawn size (cover/contain/stretch,
  never enlarged) as premultiplied ARGB, a 32 MiB LRU decoded cache, an 8 MiB
  encoded cache shared across sizes, cancellation on unmount and
  `Image.prefetch`. Engine patches add image unloading and size a flow child's
  main axis from a definite cross size and `aspectRatio`. See docs/IMAGES.md.

- Add opt-in receipt-backed recovery of published downloads after app interruption.
  Verify the full SHA-256 and original request/storage/file identity without
  contacting the provider; preserve unowned or damaged existing destinations.
  Expose filesystem device/inode IDs as lossless strings for app storage guards.

- Add split-manifest downloads with source-relative HTTP ranges and direct
  output-offset writes, SHA-1 piece and SHA-256 file verification in one read,
  exact expected sizes, storage-root identity guards, and exclusive publication.
  Export `DownloadFormats` for image, package, archive and binary destinations.
  Package installation and archive extraction remain external operations.

- Add native `Http.request` and `Downloads.enqueue` with validated parallel
  ranges, bounded 8 MiB file buffers, an independent disk writer, cancellation,
  durable range checkpoints and optional SHA-256 verification. PS5 networking
  is opt-in with pinned PacBrew ports and native-title compatibility; hardware
  operation and throughput remain unverified. Add localhost native and JS
  lifecycle coverage to `npm test`.

- Focus scrolling steps once per presented frame, through a new host frame
  callback (`globalThis.__ps5ReactFrame`), in whole pixels: it speeds up over
  four frames, cruises at 40 logical px per frame and brakes to the target.
  It used to step from a 16 ms timer with an exponential ease: on the PS5,
  frames with no timer tick presented no motion (about 45 per 330 scrolling
  frames in five Overdrive runs) and every scroll ended in a crawl of 1-3 px
  steps (about 110 frames). Now there are none of either, and a held key
  scrolls at a constant 60 px per frame.
- The PS5 frame log's engine split (`ERUI_PERF_STATS`) reads the time-stamp
  counter (`sceKernelReadTsc`, about 11 ns) instead of `clock_gettime` (about
  0.88 µs). The engine reads that clock around every blit and bridge call, so a
  full-screen frame paid 10-15 ms for its own statistics: opening an Overdrive
  game page went from a 51 ms to a 36 ms frame and going back from 39 to 20 ms.
  Raster figures logged before this change include that overhead.
- On AVX2 targets (the PS5) the software backend blends eight pixels per step,
  bit-identical to the scalar loops.
- When the surface matches the render size, the presenter keeps the frame in
  two buffer textures (`texelFetch`) and uploads changed rows with
  `glBufferSubData`. On the PS5 that costs about 0.46 ms for 1920×540 rows
  against 14.9 ms through `glTexSubImage2D`; opening an Overdrive game page went
  from an 80 ms to a 53 ms frame, and the gallery's 28 ms image-change frame
  fits in 16.7 ms. Scroll moves need no GPU copy there. Other sizes keep the
  scaled texture.
- A horizontal ScrollView beside a transparent container, such as a section
  header whose box overlaps the rail through a negative margin, scrolls by
  copy again instead of repainting its whole viewport each frame. On the PS5
  the Overdrive genre rail went from 23 ms frames (about 43 fps) for the whole
  scroll to 60 fps.
- The PS5 host writes klog lines from a writer thread. A synchronous
  `sceKernelDebugOutText` on the render thread took 0.1-1 ms per line and
  stalled a frame by about 9 ms one to two times a minute (once by 1.45 s).

- `--app-dir <path>` previews, watches, and builds an app outside `apps/`;
  `create --dir <parent>` scaffolds one. Build receipts record app sources as
  `app/<path>` instead of `apps/<name>/<path>`.

- Build the optional filesystem helper with the app payload SDK v0.42 instead
  of the upstream builder's v0.40, which lacks firmware 13.60 initialization.
  Preserve the full 32-byte credential attributes required by the new SDK API.
  The previous helper SIGILL/EOF is documented; the user confirmed the replacement
  filesystem integration on firmware 13.60 with kstuff and ShadowMount.

- Initialize libSceNet and allocate a network pool before the optional Lapy
  helper request. Added stage-specific native transport errors after hardware
  logs showed the previous request failed with status 9 before elevation.
- Optional `filesystemAccess: "console"` packages the pinned upstream Lapy
  exact-title helper and requests filesystem access once before starting React.
  System Explorer enables it. Root aliases are preserved after successful
  elevation. A resident Lapy service or local ELF loader on port 9021 is required;
  the exact tested application/helper hashes are recorded in hardware evidence.
- PS5 storage queries use the native-title `_fstatfs` export, following the
  ProsperoStore reference, with bounded discovery of accessible mount records.
  Removed direct syscalls after hardware logs confirmed a fatal
  `SYSTEM_ILLEGAL_FUNCTION_CALL`. The replacement was user-confirmed on firmware 13.60.
- PS5 directory listing validates record lengths and filename boundaries before
  invoking callbacks; malformed buffers return an I/O error.
- System Explorer queries storage on directory navigation or explicit Refresh,
  rather than on every React render. Desktop tests cover native storage bindings
  and error propagation.

- Build-time `className` styling: a subset of Tailwind CSS v3 utilities compiles
  to literal style objects on any JSX element, scaled to the render width.
- State variants (`focused:`, `selected:`, `disabled:`, `active:`, `checked:`,
  `pressed:`) driven by props of the same name; `hover:`, `focus:`, and
  `focus-visible:` are aliases of `focused:`.
- Pinned dependencies can carry reviewed patches from `patches/`. Embedded React
  is patched so auto-height `flex-wrap` rows grow to hold every wrapped line.
- `tw` tagged templates exported from `@ps5-react/core`.
- Optional per-app `tailwind.config.js` for `baseWidth` and theme overrides,
  including font files that are baked automatically.
- Unsupported classes and runtime-computed class names fail the build with a
  source location.
- The starter uses `className`; its snapshots match the explicit-style version.
- React Native-style native modules in `@ps5-react/core`: `Platform`,
  `DeviceInfo`, `FileSystem`, `Notifications`, `Users`, `Controller` with the
  `useGamepad` hook, `Linking`, and `BackHandler`, implemented by both hosts through the
  `__ps5ReactNative` contract. The desktop preview uses a per-app sandbox. The
  PS5 implementation is not yet hardware-validated. See `docs/NATIVE-API.md`.
- `apps/system-explorer` (`PPSA99056`) demonstrates every native module.
- Motion-style animation in `@ps5-react/core`: `motion.*` components,
  `AnimatePresence`, variants with stagger, and `transitions` presets, driven by
  the engine without per-frame JavaScript. `Animated`, `useAnimatedValue`,
  `Easing`, `LayoutAnimation`, and `Pressable` are re-exported. See
  `docs/ANIMATION.md` for the API, performance rules, and design guidelines.
- Tailwind animation classes (`animate-in`, `fade-in`, `slide-in-from-*`,
  `zoom-in`, `animate-out`, `duration-*`, `delay-*`, `ease-*`, `transition`,
  `animate-spin`/`pulse`/`bounce`/`ping`) compile to motion props at build time.
- Both hosts log a frame-time summary every two seconds (`[PS5-REACT] frame:
  fps=… total avg=… p95=… max=…` with input, update, present, and swap phases);
  on the PS5 it goes to the kernel log.
- `apps/motion-lab` (`PPSA99057`) demonstrates staggered entrances, focus lift
  with a gliding highlight, page transitions, Tailwind animation classes, a
  toast, and idle motion.
- Spatial D-pad navigation (`docs/NAVIGATION.md`): `View`, `Image`, and
  `Pressable` take `focusable`, `onPress`, `onFocus`/`onBlur`, `autoFocus`,
  `focusKey`, and `nextFocus*`; `FocusScope` (with `trap`, `wrap`,
  `restoreFocus`, `onBack`), `useFocusable`, `useFocus`, `useIsFocused`,
  `BackHandler.addEventListener`, and a `ScrollView` that follows focus. Hosts
  send `up`/`down`/`left`/`right`; `useController` still receives
  `previous`/`next` after them.
- The starter, the `npm run create` template, `apps/tailwind-gallery`,
  `apps/system-explorer`, and `apps/motion-lab` navigate with focusable elements
  and scopes instead of manual focus indices. The starter's snapshots are
  unchanged.
- `Svg`, `Path`, `Circle`, `Rect`, `Line`, and `G` are re-exported from
  `@ps5-react/core`.
- The engine profile scales images bilinearly, across the full 2560-pixel
  render width, registers up to 256 images, and holds 64 `<Svg>` nodes with 32
  cached (about 2.9 MB more static memory). The starter's snapshots are
  unchanged.
- `ScrollView` scrolls its focused descendant into view with the engine's
  native scroll offset (Embedded React is patched with
  `NativeUI.scrollTo`) instead of translating a content wrapper, so layout
  props stay on the ScrollView and nested rails scroll innermost first.
- `FocusScope` takes `inert`: its subtree leaves D-pad navigation, autoFocus,
  and focus restoration, and focus leaves it when it becomes inert. Use it for
  mounted but hidden screens. When no scope has a candidate, focus stays put.
- The engine profile raises the node pool and bridge handles to 2048, so two
  full screens fit during a transition; the bridge warns once when node
  creation fails instead of dropping nodes silently.
- Views take a `backgroundGradient` style (CSS linear and radial gradients,
  up to four stops), and Tailwind compiles `bg-gradient-to-*`, `from-*`,
  `via-*`, and `to-*` with stop positions to it. The engine profile enables
  `ERUI_GRADIENT` (about 23 KB more static memory). The starter's snapshots are
  unchanged.
- The frame-time summary adds the engine's own split (`js` with dispatch,
  React render, and marshal; `layout`; `raster` with pre-pass, render, and
  blit) and the repainted and written pixels per frame. Frames over 33 ms print
  a `slow frame:` line with that split and the repaint bounds. The engine
  profile enables `ERUI_PERF_STATS` for this; no overlay is drawn.
- The desktop preview replays `PS5_REACT_INPUT_SCRIPT` (for example
  `wait:3000,right*3,confirm,wait:2000,back,quit`) through the normal input
  path for reproducible profiling; `PS5_REACT_SLOW_FRAME_MS` sets the
  slow-frame threshold. See `docs/ANIMATION.md`. The PS5 host reads the same
  script from `/app0/dev/input-script.txt` when a test deploy adds that file,
  and live commands from `/app0/dev/commands.txt` while it runs.
- Embedded React is patched so a repaint over an image converts and scales only
  the repainted part instead of the whole image, bilinear scaling uses integer
  weights, and a scale animation resting at 1 no longer renders its subtree
  through the transform buffer. The starter's snapshots are unchanged.
- Controller actions reach JavaScript inside React's batch, from the frame's
  microtask drain: a handler that sets several pieces of state renders and
  commits once, and its render counts as `react` in the frame log.
- Scrolling moves the pixels already painted: Embedded React is patched so a
  ScrollView whose offset changes moves its viewport through a new backend
  `move_rect` and repaints only the exposed strip, falling back to a full
  viewport repaint when anything but a solid background shares those pixels.
  Both hosts replay the move on the GPU texture instead of uploading the
  viewport again.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-05

Initial experimental source release.

- React/JSX runtime backed by QuickJS and Embedded React software rendering.
- Shared OpenGL framebuffer presenter and independent PS5 application host.
- Native macOS preview with rebuild/restart on save.
- Controller hook, counter starter, app manifests, and app scaffolding.
- Pinned dependency bootstrap, folder/ZIP builds, integrity checks, and receipts.

The baseline proof of concept was user-tested on PS5 firmware 13.60. The
reorganized framework starter is not yet independently hardware-tested.
