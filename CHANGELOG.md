# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Build-time `className` styling: a subset of Tailwind CSS v3 utilities compiles
  to literal style objects on any JSX element, scaled to the render width.
- State variants (`focused:`, `selected:`, `disabled:`, `active:`, `checked:`,
  `pressed:`) driven by props of the same name; `hover:`, `focus:`, and
  `focus-visible:` are aliases of `focused:`.
- Pinned dependencies can carry reviewed patches from `patches/`. Embedded React
  is patched so auto-height `flex-wrap` rows grow to hold every wrapped line.
- `tw` tagged templates exported from `@ps5-react/core`.
- Optional per-app `tailwind.config.js` for `baseWidth` and theme overrides,
  including font files that are baked automatically.
- Unsupported classes and runtime-computed class names fail the build with a
  source location.
- The starter uses `className`; its snapshots match the explicit-style version.
- React Native-style native modules in `@ps5-react/core`: `Platform`,
  `DeviceInfo`, `FileSystem`, `Notifications`, `Users`, `Controller` with the
  `useGamepad` hook, `Linking`, and `BackHandler`, implemented by both hosts through the
  `__ps5ReactNative` contract. The desktop preview uses a per-app sandbox. The
  PS5 implementation is not yet hardware-validated. See `docs/NATIVE-API.md`.
- `apps/system-explorer` (`PPSA99056`) demonstrates every native module.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-05

Initial experimental source release.

- React/JSX runtime backed by QuickJS and Embedded React software rendering.
- Shared OpenGL framebuffer presenter and independent PS5 application host.
- Native macOS preview with rebuild/restart on save.
- Controller hook, counter starter, app manifests, and app scaffolding.
- Pinned dependency bootstrap, folder/ZIP builds, integrity checks, and receipts.

The baseline proof of concept was user-tested on PS5 firmware 13.60. The
reorganized framework starter is not yet independently hardware-tested.
